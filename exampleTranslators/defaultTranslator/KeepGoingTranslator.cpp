/*
There are several levels of keep going support

1. GNU make's -k option

make will try to compile every file that can be tried and show as many compilation errors as possible

2. ROSE's buildin -rose:keep_going support

Similar to GNU Make's --keep-going option.

If ROSE encounters an error while processing your
input code, ROSE will simply run your backend compiler on
your original source code file, as is, without modification.

This is useful for compiler tests. For example,
when compiling a 100K LOC application, you can
try to compile as much as possible, ignoring failures,
in order to gauge the overall status of your translator,
with respect to that application.

3. src/frontend/SageIII/sage_support/keep_going.h /.cpp

 Rose::KeepGoing namespace provides support for creating a translator,
 which internally uses -rose:keep_going and keeps track of successfully processed or failed files, and save such information into log files.
