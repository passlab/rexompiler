### Development documents
This is development doc for REX compiler that are generated using original ROSE `make html` and `make lcov lcov_genhtml` targets:

* [Doxygen API](www/ROSE_HTML_Reference). Some HTML files might be deleted because of the github restrictions.  
* [Code coverage](www/lcov_output). Code coverage are generated by `--enable-lcov` in the `configure`. And the coverage is collected by performing three tests(core, OpenMP_tests and astInterfaceTest).
