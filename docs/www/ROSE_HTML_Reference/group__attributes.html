<p>Attaching user-defined attributes to objects.</p>
<p>Many ROSE classes allow users to define and store their own data in the form of <em>attributes</em>. An attribute is a name/value pair where the name uniquely identifies the attribute within the container object and the value has a user-defined type.</p>
<p>ROSE supports three interfaces for attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sage IR nodes derived from <a class="el" href="classSgNode.html">SgNode</a> have a built-in interface for storing heap-allocated attributes. The applicable methods all have "attribute" as part of their names. This interface is built upon <a class="el" href="classAstAttributeMechanism.html">AstAttributeMechanism</a>. This interface provides a way for the user to make multiple passes over the AST and save state information into the AST for subsequent traversals. The mechanism is different from creation of inherited and synthesized attributes within the AST processing mechanism (ASTProcessing) since those attributes are allocated and deallocated automatically on the stack. </li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="classAstAttributeMechanism.html">AstAttributeMechanism</a> provides a mechanism by which heap-allocated attributes derived from <a class="el" href="classAstAttribute.html">AstAttribute</a> can be stored in an object. Such attributes are copied (by reallocating) whenever their container is copied so that they are never shared between two containers. The <a class="el" href="classAstAttributeMechanism.html" title="Stores named attributes in Sage IR nodes.">AstAttributeMechanism</a> container owns these attributes and deletes them when the container is destroyed. </li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="namespaceSawyer.html" title="Name space for the entire library.">Sawyer</a> support library has a <a class="el" href="namespaceSawyer_1_1Attribute.html">Sawyer::Attribute</a> namespace that provides a mechanism for storing values that are instances of POD types and 3rd-party types that the user cannot edit. It stores attributes by value, and uses the value's normal C++ constructors and destructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are three interfaces, they really all share the same basic mechanism. <a class="el" href="classSgNode.html" title="This class represents the base class for all IR nodes within Sage III.">SgNode</a> attributes are implemented in terms of the <a class="el" href="classAstAttributeMechanism.html" title="Stores named attributes in Sage IR nodes.">AstAttributeMechanism</a>, which is implemented in terms of <a class="el" href="namespaceSawyer_1_1Attribute.html" title="Attributes attached to other objects.">Sawyer::Attribute</a>.</p>

<p>Some examples may help illuminate the differences. The examples show three methods of using attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Method 1</b> uses the <a class="el" href="namespaceSawyer_1_1Attribute.html" title="Attributes attached to other objects.">Sawyer::Attribute</a> interface directly. </li>
<li><b>Method 2</b> uses the <a class="el" href="classAstAttributeMechanism.html">AstAttributeMechanism</a> interface. </li>
<li><b>Method 3</b> uses the <a class="el" href="classSgNode.html">SgNode</a> attribute interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us assume that two types exist in some library header file somewhere and the user wants to store these as attribute values in some object. The two value types are:</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> Let us also assume that a ROSE developer has a class and wants the user to be able to store attributes in objects of that class. The first step is for the ROSE developer to prepare his class for storing attributes:</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> Method 1 is designed to use inheritance: all of its methods have the word "attribute" in their names. Method 2 could be used by inheritance, but is more commonly used with containment due to its short, common method names like <code>size</code>. Method 3 applies only to Sage IR nodes, but creating a new subclass of <a class="el" href="classSgNode.html" title="This class represents the base class for all IR nodes within Sage III.">SgNode</a> is outside the scope of this document; instead, we'll just use an existing IR node type.</p>
<p>Now we jump into the user code. The user wants to be able to store two attributes, one of each value type. As mentioned above, the attribute value types are defined in some library header, and the class of objects in which to store them is defined in a ROSE header file. Method 1 an store values of any type, but the user has more work to do before he can use methods 2 or 3:</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> Method 1 requires no additional wrapper code since it can store any value directly. Methods 2 and 3 both require a substantial amount of boilerplate to store even a simple enum value. The <code>copy</code> method's purpose is to allocate a new copy of an attribute when the object holding the attribute is copied or assigned. The copy method should be implemented in every <a class="el" href="classAstAttribute.html">AstAttribute</a> subclass, although few do. If it's not implemented then one of two things happen: either the attribute is not copied, or only a superclass of the attribute is copied. Subclasses must also implement <code>attribute_class_name</code>, although few do. Neither <code>copy</code> nor <code>attribute_class_name</code> are pure virtual because of limitations with ROSETTA code generation.</p>
<p>Next, the user will want to use descriptive strings for the attribute so error messages are informative, but shorter names in C++ code, so we declare the attribute names:</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> The declarations in methods 2 and 3 are identical. Method 1 differs by using an integral type for attribute IDs, which has two benefits: (1) it prevents two users from using the same attribute name for different purposes, and (2) it reduces the size and increases the speed of the underlying storage maps by storing integer keys rather than strings. Method 1 has functions that convert between identification numbers and strings if necessary (e.g., error messages).</p>
<p>Now, let us see how to insert two attributes into an object assuming that the object came from somewhere far away and we don't know whether it already contains these attributes. If it does, we want to overwrite their old values with new values. Overwriting values is likely to be a more common operation than insert-if-nonexistent. After all, languages generally don't have a dedicated assign-value-if-none-assigned operator (Perl and Bash being exceptions).</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> Method 1 stores the attribute directly while Methods 2 and 3 require the attribute value to be wrapped in a heap-allocated object first.</p>
<p>Eventually the user will want to retrieve an attribute's value. Users commonly need to obtain the attribute or a default value.</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> Method 1 has a couple functions dedicated to this common scenario. Methods 2 and 3 return a null pointer if the attribute doesn't exist, but require a dynamic cast to the appropriate type otherwise.</p>
<p>Sooner or later a user will want to erase an attribute. Perhaps the attribute holds the result of some optional analysis which is no longer valid. The user wants to ensure that the attribute doesn't exist, but isn't sure whether it currently exists:</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> If the attribute didn't exist then none of these methods do anything. If it did exist... With Method 1, the value's destructor is called. Methods 2 and 3 delete the heap-allocated value, which is allowed since the attribute container owns the object.</p>
<p>Finally, when the object containing the attributes is destroyed the user needs to be able to clean up by destroying the attributes that are attached:</p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p> All three interfaces now properly clean up their attributes, although this wasn't always the case with methods 2 and 3. </p>
